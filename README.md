## Android Engineer - Tech Test

### Introduction

We would like you to demonstrate your knowledge of Android development by creating a simple app to show an interactive list of hospitals in the UK. The app should be able to:
1. Download the hospital data that can be found at the following URL: `https://draysontechnologies.github.io/shtest.github.io/hospitals.json`.
1. Display a list of these hospitals to the user
1. Show further details of a hospital when selected by the user
1. Allow this list to be filtered by a field of your choice (for example to let the user view only NHS hospitals)

### Implementation

We are interested to see how you:
* Interact with the remote data source
* Pass data between different parts of the app
* Present the hospital data to the user
* Architect and structure your application
* How you choose to test your code

The visual appearance of the app is not a priority, but you are encouraged to use standard practices for reasonably good UX (responsive app, no long computations on the UI thread, simple navigation, etc). Don't worry about edge-case error handling or complex design patterns.

It would be good to examples of unit tests and/or instrumentation tests, but don't worry about anything beyond this.

Keep it simple! You are free to use third-party libraries and frameworks, but bear in mind we'd also like to see you display your base knowledge of Android. You can use either Java or Kotlin.

### Requirements

Submit your completed solution either as a git repository (using a public repo service such as Github or Bitbucket), or as a zip file (making sure you include the .git directory). Commit early and often rather than in a single large commit; trial and error is acceptable and even encouraged as it really helps us capture your thinking.

Your solution should contain instructions sufficient to allow a technical user to run your app (ideally a README.md including, e.g. instructions to build and run the app using Android Studio).
